# Sales-data-analysis

In this project, I have analyzed 12 month's electronic product sales data.

I tried to find answers to the following questions and visualize them :

* what was the best month for sales?

* which city had the highest sales?

* At what time advertisements should be displayed for maximum likelihood of product purchase?

* Which products are most often sold together?

* What product was sold most and why?
